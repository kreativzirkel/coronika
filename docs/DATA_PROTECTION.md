# Data Protection

The app Coronika processes personal and location-related data exclusively locally on the smartphone of the user.

## Personal data

The user can create persons within the app. The name and a telephone number are saved. Furthermore, it is possible to import the phone book of the smartphone. The names and phone numbers of the entries in the phonebook are transferred to the app. All the data remains locally on the smartphone and therefore in the hands of the user. The data is never transferred to the app provider or third parties.

## Location-based data

The user can create locations within the app. The name of the location and a description are saved. The user's location via positioning services (e.g. GPS or similar) is not accessed at any time. The location-related data also remains local on the user's smartphone and is not transmitted to the app provider or third parties.

## Diary

Within the diary, the user assigns persons and places to individual days on a daily basis. In addition to the data already collected, a time is also stored for the places. The diary and all entries also remain locally on the user's smartphone and are not transmitted to the app provider or third parties.

## Export

Within the app the user has an export function to export a section of the diary as a PDF file. The PDF file is created locally on the user's smartphone. This PDF file can be used to easily provide health authorities or other official bodies with a list of contacts in a selected period of time in order to trace paths of infection and, if necessary, inform other people about a potential infection. The user is responsible for handling the PDF file and the data contained in it responsibly and not to pass it on carelessly.

## Data transfer and tracking

The app does not provide automated tracking or data transfer to the app provider or third parties. The only exception is the export function. There, however, only the user decides to whom the data is passed on. Otherwise, all data remains locally on the user's smartphone.
